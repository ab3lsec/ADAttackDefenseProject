# Pass the Password Attack

Pass Attacks are Post compromise attacks where we need to have the credentials of a compromised user on the domain in the form of plain text or hash.<br>
There are two types of PASS ATTACK:
1. Pass the PASSWORD
2. Pass the HASH

### WHAT IS PASS THE PASSWORD ATTACK?

In a pass the password attack, we try to login to systems/computers using the cleartext password that we have. <br>
In some cases, the compromised user can be admin on other machines. So when we pass the password throughout the TARGET SUBNET, the other machine which have this user as an admin will also be compromised.
<br>
For example, if we have password of `Bruce Wayne` who is Local Admin of both BATMAN and FLASH user machines. When we pass the password of `Bruce Wayne` through the subnet.<br>
It will successfully authenticate his machine `BATMAN` and also the tool tries to authenticate and compromise `FLASH`. 

### PASS THE PASSWORD ATTACK LAB

To perform Pass the PASSWORD attack we need to use a tool called `crackmapexec` <br>
`crackmapexec` will check the given domain and return all the machines that can be authenticated using compromised users USERNAME and PASSWORD and if the authentication is successfull then it returns a "`Pwn3d!!`" status.<br>

```
crackmapexec smb 192.168.31.0/24 -u batman -d HERO.local -p Password1
```

<br>Once you get a list of machines we can use the credentials and do a bunch of things:
1.  Gain an interactive shell on FLASH using tools like `psexec` 
2. We can use tools like `secretdump.py`  and  dump locally stored SAM database which contains the NTLM hashes of all local users.

#### 1. GAINING AN NTERACTIVE SHELL USING PSEXEC 

```
psexec.py HERO/batman:Password1@192.168.31.145 
```

#### 2. DUMPING HASHES USING SECRETSDUMP:

In our case `FLASH` can be compromised using Bruce Wayne's password. So we can use `secretsdump` tool and pass the password of `Bruce Wayne` to dump the SAM database.
SAM database stores local user hashes in NTLM format.

```
secretsdump.py HERO/batman:Password1@192.168.31.145 
```

<br>Here we got a list of Local user accounts and their corresponding NTLM hashes. We also got the hash of the user `Barry Allen` who is another domain user of `HERO.local`. <br>
We can take his NTLM hash and crack them using tools like `hashcat`
