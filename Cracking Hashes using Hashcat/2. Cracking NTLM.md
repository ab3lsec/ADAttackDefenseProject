Windows stores the user credentials in form of NTLM hashes.<br>  
In Pass the Password attack, we were able to dump the local SAM database of `FLASH` which contained the NTLM hash of the domain user `Barry Allen`.
<br>
These hashes can be cracked into plaintext passwords using a tool called `hashcat`.<br>
Once we find the plaintext password of the local users, we can use it to laterally move through the domains and compromise more computers via Pass the Password attack.

```
hashcat -m 1000 ntlmhash.txt rockyou.txt -O
```
`-m 1000` : denotes module, NTLM hashes uses 1000 in hashcat.<br>
`-O` : for optimisation.<br>
