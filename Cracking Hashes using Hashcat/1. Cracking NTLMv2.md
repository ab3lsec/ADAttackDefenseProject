# Cracking NTLMv2 Hash using Hashcat

In attacks like LLMNR Poisoning, LLMNR protocol responds with the users username and NTLMv2 password Hash of domain user. <br>
We can use this NTLMv2 Hash, crack it and obtain plaintext password out of it using tools like `hashcat`  or `JohntheRipper`.<br>
In this example lets see how we can crack the NTLMv2 hash of user "`Bruce Wayne`" which we obtained via LLMNR Poisoning attack.<br>

```
hashcat -m 5600 ntlmhash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
```
`-m` : denotes module, NTLMv2 hashes uses 5600 in hashcat.<br>
`ntlmhash.txt` : it is the text file where we saved the hash we obtained<br>
`rockyou.txt` : it is a common wordlist with lakhs of cracked passwords.<br>
<br>
`-O ` (optimise) : it is used if you are running hashcat on your base OS. this will give a faster and optimised result.
<br>
`--force` : this is used when you are running hashcat on a VM.

<br>Now we cracked the hash and the password of `Bruce Wayne` is "`Password1`"
