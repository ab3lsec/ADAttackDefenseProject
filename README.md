# Active Directory Security Assessment and Hardening: Practical Attacks and Defense Strategies

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
The project will focus on identifying common security vulnerabilities within Active Directory environments and demonstrating how to exploit them using various techniques such as SMB relay, LLMNR poisoning, pass the hash, token impersonation, GPP attacks, and kerberoasting. Additionally, the project will explore robust defense strategies and mitigation techniques to counter these attacks effectively.
