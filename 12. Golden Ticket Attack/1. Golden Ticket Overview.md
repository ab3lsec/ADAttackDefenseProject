# Golden Ticket Attack Overview

### WHAT IS A KDC IN KERBEROS?

- KDC stands for Key Distribution Center
- KDC is a service that issues TGT tickets to clients so they can access services with proper authentication and authorization
- Just like other services on AD, KDC also has a service account named #KRBTGT
- #KRBTGT is created by default during the AD installation

### GOLDEN TICKET ATTACK EXPLAINED:

The golden ticket attacks are post-exploitation attacks which gives the attacker unrestricted access to the domain. 

Golden ticket attack involves compromising the `krbtgt` account which is used by the KDC to grant kerberos tickets. Once we get the access to `krbtgt`, we will get the control over the KDC.

Since we are controlling KDC which is responsible for issuing Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs), then we have the golden ticket to access any resource on the domain. This means we can compromise any user accounts on the domain.
