# IPv6 Attack Defence and Mitigation Strategies

IPv6 attacks is possible because of the fact that Windows try to resolve them even if the environment usually work with IPv4. Similarly in the Lab we saw that the user machines usually used IPv4 for Resolution but when an IPv6 address was introduced it was preferred over the IPv4 address.  <br>
Some of the defences strategies to mitigate this attack are:

### 1. ADD RULES TO BLOCK IPv6 TRAFFIC

Disabling IPv6 entirely is not a viable solution for this attack. If you don’t use IPv6 internally, the safest way to prevent mitm6 is to block DHCPv6 traffic and incoming router advertisements in Windows Firewall via Group Policy.
- _(Inbound) Core Networking - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6(DHCPV6-In)_
- _(Inbound) Core Networking - Router Advertisement (ICMPv6-In)_
- _(Outbound) Core Networking - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6(DHCPV6-Out)_

### 2. DISABLE WPAD FEATURE

WPAD stands for Windows Proxy auto detection, if this feature is not used internally there is an option to disable it. This can be done by disabling `WinHttpAutoProxySvc` service.

### 3. ENABLE LDAP SIGNING FEATURE

In SMB Relay attack we saw how SMB signing feature prevented the attack completeley. <br>
Similarly LDAP Relay attack can be stopped by enabling LDAP Signing and LDAP channel binding features.
