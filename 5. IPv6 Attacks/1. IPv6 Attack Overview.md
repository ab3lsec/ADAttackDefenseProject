# IPv6 Attack Overview

- IPv6 is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol and has been installed by default on operating systems.
- Since IPv6 is enabled by default and preferred over IPv4, systems will prioritize available IPv6 network connections.

### ATTACK METHODOLOGY

- If IPV6 is enabled on a target, it will constantly look for DNS servers for IPv6 resolution by sending DHCPv6 requests.
- In this case we can use a tool which reply to all the DHCPv6 requests from the windows clients on the network.
- Since Link local address doesn't need a DHCP server, this gives us the opportunity to set the attackers IP as the default IPv6 DNS server for the victims.
- In this case the target will send all the IPv6 DNS requests to the attacker IP.
- Now we can trigger an event on the target like a Restart and this will come through our IP and we can relay those credentials to login to the Domain Controller.

In order to accomplish this attack we need following set of tools.

1. `mitm6`: This will act as IPv6 Router during the attack.
2. `ntlmrelayx.py`: This will capture the NTLM credentials from the client and relay them to target machine (Domain Controller)
