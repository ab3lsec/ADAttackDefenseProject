There are two possible ways for attacking IPv6 feature:
1. Getting access to DC via DNS Takeover with LDAP Relaying
2. Delegate Impersonation attack 

Lets first discuss about DNS takeover with Getting access to DC via DNS Takeover with LDAP Relaying Attack.
<br>
### STEP 1. PRIMARY DNS TAKEOVER
For performing this we will use a tool called `mitm6`. This tool starts with listening on the primary interface of the attacker machine for Windows clients requesting an IPv6 configuration via DHCPv6. Every machine will request this regularly in different intervals.  
<br>
mitm6 automatically detects the IP configuration of the attacker machine and replies to DHCPv6 requests sent by clients in the network (`BATMAN` and `FLASH`) with a DHCPv6 reply with a link local address (FE80::) containing the attacker’s IP as DNS server.

```
mitm6 -d HERO.local
```

### STEP 2. DNS SPOOFING

Since IPv6 is preferred over IPv4. Now the clients DNS configuration will have the attackers IP as their DNS server.<br>
So now when the client make a DNS lookup query, it will be forwarded to the attacker's machine.

### STEP 3. EXPLOITING WPAD

The next step in the attack is to make the clients connect to the attackers machine thinking that they are real DNS servers. <br>
For this we need to spoof URLs in the internal domain `HERO.local`
<br>
Once IPv6 address is assigned, immediately the client starts requesting information about a WPAD server `wpad.HERO.local` <br>

<br>WPAD stands for Web Proxy Auto Detect. It helps the clients to automatically detect the proxy server if they are not set manually. 
This is the part we will be exploiting during this attack.

##### HOW WPAD ABUSE WORKS?
When a client request for WPAD, the DNS will resolve and point to a server which hosts `wpad.dat` file.<br>
If no results is returned then,
- the client will try to resolve it locally by broadcasting the request via INSECURE protocols like `LLMNR` 
- An attacker can reply to these broadcast pretending to be a server hosting `wpad.dat` file and prompt the client for authentication.
- This authentication is done by default in Windows without user interaction
- After his authentication, the attacker will capture the `NTLM` hashes of the user that is logged into that system.

But after 2016 they have added more protection:
1. Now location of the WPAD file is not requested via LLMNR, but only via DNS.
2. Authentication does not occur automatically

To bypass first protection, we have already spoofed the client saying that attacker's machine is the DNS server, so when a client requests WPAD, the attacker can just reply with his own IP address. ***This works even if the organization has a WPAD file*.**
<br>
To bypass second protection, instead of requiring client authentication we can rather provide it with a valid WPAD file where attacker’s machine is set as a proxy. <br>
Now when the victim connects to our “proxy” server, we can reply with "HTTP 407", which says proxy authentication required now the client will automatically authenticate with NTLM Hashes.

### STEP 4. RELAYING CREDENTIALS USING NTLMRELAYX

To relay the hashes that we obtained by abusing WPAD, we need to set a tool called `ntlmrelayx` which relays the NTLM credentials to other machines on the network via `LDAP RELAYING`. <br>
Through this we can set the DOMAIN CONTROLLER (`JUSTICE-DC`) as the target and access it to dump valuable information like users, groups, Domain Admins, Local Admins etc..

```
ntlmrelayx -6 -t ldaps://"DC IP" -wh fakewpad.MARVEL.local -l lootme
```
`-6` : is set to make sure `ntlmrelayx` listens on both IPv4 and IPv6
`-t` : is set to denote the Target i.e our `JUSTICE-DC` IP and it is accessed via LDAP secure protocol.
`-wh` : is set to specify a fake WPAD host where the WPAD file resides on.
`-l` : is set to create a folder named "lootme". This folder will contain all the valuable information that we gathered from the JUSTICE-DC.

<br>Using `ntlmrelayx` we have successfully authenticated to the Domain Controller (`JUSTICE-DC`) as the user Bruce Wayne of `HERO/batman` machine.
<br>
And sensitive Domain Information like Domain users, groups, computers, domain policy etc.. from `JUSTICE-DC` is dumped into the "lootme" directory.

<br>This has all the information about the Domain Admins, Administrators, when they were created, updated and when did they last login. This also has their description.<br>
