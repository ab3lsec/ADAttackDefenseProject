# Token Impersonation Defence and Mitigation Strategies

### 1. LIMIT USER TOKEN CREATION PERMISSION

By modifying User token creation permission, you limit the ability of an attacker to create or adjust access tokens on `BATMAN`. This reduces the risk of an attacker using an elevated access token to impersonate `HERO\Administrator` and gain unauthorized access to `BATMAN`.

```
GPO: Computer Configuration > [Policies] > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment: Create a token object. 
```

In the setting, we can remove all the unnecessary accounts which has token creation privileges,
### 2.  ACCOUNT TIERING 

In this concept the DOMAIN ADMINS (`HERO\Administrator`) should only login to  DOMAIN CONTROLLER (`JUSTICE-DC`).<br>
For this DOMAIN admin can have two accounts: one for normal daily usage and other one for administrative usage with more security controls.

### 3. LOCAL ADMIN RESTRICTION

If users are not Local administrators on their respective computers, then the attacker cannot get a elevated user shell to load the `incognito` module and impersonate other tokens.<br>
For Example: Imagine `Bruce Wayne` is not a local admin on `BATMAN`. In this case even if the attacker compromise user `Bruce Wayne`. They cannot get a `NT/AUTHORITY` shell which prevents the working of `incognito` and stops the attack
