# Kerberoasting Attack LAB DEMO

For tis attack lab we will use the Domain Controller (`JUSTICE-DC`) as the KDC and `Bruce Wayne` as the user requesting the tickets. We also have a service account on the domain named `SQLService`.
<br>In our case, `Bruce Wayne` is a valid user on the domain and we already have his credentials (`batman:Password1`). We can use this user to request a TGS for the `SQLService`.
<br>
We can attempt this using an impacket tool called `GetUserSPNs.py`  which makes a request to the Domain Controller's IP and the tool will identify the available SPNs and dump the Service account hash i.e. `SQLService` in our case.

```
GetUserSPNs.py HERO.local/batman:Password1 -dc-ip 192.168.31.136 -request
```

Using the tool, we successfully identified the `SQLService` account and the tool dumped the contents of TGS with the the account hash of `SQLService`.
<br>
Now we can copy this hash to a text file and use a tool like `hashcat` to crack the hash. Hashcat already has a dedicated module (`13100`) to crack the service account hash out of TGS.

```
hashcat -m 13100 SQLservHASH.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -O
```
`-m 13100`  : denotes module, NTLMv2 hashes uses 13100 in hashcat.<br>
`SQLservHASH.txt` : it is the text file where we saved the TGS hash we obtained<br>
`rockyou.txt` : it is a common wordlist with lakhs of cracked passwords.

We have successfully obtained the cleartext password of `SQLService` which is `MYpassword123#`.
<br>
One interesting thing is, during our initial lab setup we have configured `SQLService` account as a Domain Administrator. Now we have the cleartext password of this account, as an attacker we can use this credentials and make changes to the domain like adding malicious user accounts, deleting existing users etc..
