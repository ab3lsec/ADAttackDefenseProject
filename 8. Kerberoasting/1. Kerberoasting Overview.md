# Kerberoasting Attack Overview

Kerberoasting is a Post Exploitation attack which takes advantage of the working of Kerberos Authentication in Windows. Once we obtain the credentials of valid users on domain through  initial AD attacks, we can attempt Kerberoasting.
### HOW KERBEROS WORKS?

Kerberos is a computer network authentication protocol that provides a secure way for users and services to authenticate each other over a non-secure network.
Normally a user, requests the Domain Controller to grant a ticket to access a specific service.

1. User logs on with username & password. The Password is then converted to NTLM hash, and sent to the Domain Controller for authentication. 

2. The Domain Controller also known as `KDC` (Key Distribution Center) checks information sent by the user and it its valid, the DC will create a Ticket-Granting Ticket (`TGT`).

3. The `TGT` is then sent to the requesting user which is encrypted using Kerberos Service account hash (`KRBTGT`). The contents of the `TGT` can be only red by the Kerberos service.

4. Imagine we have a Server running a service like SQL. Each service on the domain will have an SPN (Service Principal Name) which acts as a unique identifier for each service.

5. Whenever the user wants to access a specific service, it makes another request to the DC using the received TGT along with the `SPN (Service Principal Name)` of the service to which the user needs to access.

6. The DC then checks the `TGT` and if its valid, the DC replies with the Ticket Granting Service (`TGS`) which is encrypted using the requested service account's hash.

7. The user connects to the server hosting the service on the appropriate port & presents the `TGS`. The service decrypts the `TGS` ticket using its NTLM password hash and if the `TGS` is valid, access is granted to the user.

### KERBEROASTING ATTACK

The major goal of Kerberoasting is to obtain the `TGS` and decrypt the service account's hash.

- For obtaining a TGS we need to get the TGT first. 
- Any Valid user on the domain with a proper username and a password can request for TGT. This user doesn't have to be an admin or doesn't need any other permissions.
- Once we get the TGT, we can look for the available services and obtain its SPN. 
- With that SPN and TGT, we will request the TGS.
- In normal usage Once we receive the TGS, we will pass the TGS to specific server and get the resource access.
- But instead we can copy the Service account hash and decrypt it using tools like `hashcat`  to obtain the cleartext password of Service Account.
- This is known as Kerberoasting Attack.
