# Kerberoasting Defence and Mitigation Strategies

In Kerberoasting attack we are abusing a feature of Windows which is Kerberos authentication protocol. So there's no settings or anything that we can use to prevent this attack because most of the windows systems utilises Kerberos Authentication and disabling that feature is not a practical approach. But instead we can use some best practises to reduce the impact of the attack:

### 1. IMPLEMENT A STRONG PASSWORD POLICY
Weak passwords can be cracked easily using a proper Password wordlist<br>
So make sure that Service Accounts have Complex passwords like:
- A mix of characters, numbers and Special Characters
- Avoid Common Dictionary words
- Don't use passwords like `P@55w0rd`, even though they have combination of different characters and numbers, they can be easily guessed.

### 2. IMPLEMENT LEAST PRIVILEGE
Principle of least privilege (POLP) is a computer security concept and practice that gives users limited access rights based on the tasks necessary to their job. Enforce the principle of least privilege for all service accounts.
<br>
In our case `SQLService` account was configured as a Domain Administrator, this is really dangerous because as an attacker we can use this account to make changes to the domain like adding malicious user accounts, deleting existing users etc..
