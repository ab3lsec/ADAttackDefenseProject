# Pass Attack Defence and Mitigation Strategies

Preventing this attack completely is difficult because attacks like Pass the Password completely depends on how strong your password is. But we as an administrator we can make it more challenging for the attacker.<br>
Here are some common defence strategies that we can use to mitigate Pass attack:

### 1. IMPLEMENT A STRONG PASSWORD POLICY
Weak passwords can be cracked easily by obtaining hashes via LLMNR poisoning<br>
So make sure that users set Complex passwords like:
- A mix of characters, numbers and Special Characters
- Avoid Common Dictionary words
- Don't use passwords like `P@55w0rd`, even though they have combination of different characters and numbers, they can be easily guessed.

### 2. IMPLEMENT LEAST PRIVILEGE
Principle of least privilege (POLP) is a computer security concept and practice that gives users limited access rights based on the tasks necessary to their job. 
In our case `Bruce Wayne` has Local admin privileges on other machines (`FLASH`) which resulted in passing the hash and gaining a shell on `FLASH`

#### 3. PRIVILEGED ACCESS MANAGEMENT (PAM)
PAM is used to manage and implement strong security controls over privileged accounts like Administrators like:
- Login/Logout to sensitive accounts like admins only if needed.
- Automatically rotate/change passwords at each Login session.
