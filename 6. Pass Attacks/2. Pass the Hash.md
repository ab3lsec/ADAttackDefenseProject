# Pass the Hash Attack

In Pass the Password attack, we used the cleartext password of `Bruce Wayne` to authenticate to `FLASH`. Obtaining plaintext passwords are rare, and if Passwords are strong then cannot be easily cracked. <br>
In situations like these, we can actually pass the hash that we obtained to successfully authenticaate to other machines on the domain.

### PASS THE HASH DEFINITION

A Pass-the-Hash (`PtH`) attack is a technique where an attacker captures a password hash (as opposed to the password characters) and then passes it through for authentication and lateral access to other networked systems. <br>
With this technique, the attacker doesn’t need to decrypt the hash to obtain a plain text password.

### PASS THE HASH ATTACK LAB

Just like we used `crackmapexec` to pass the cleartext password in Pass the Password attack. Similarly we can use the same tool to pass hashes too.<br>

```
crackmapexec smb 192.168.31.0/24 -u batman -d HERO.local -H 64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b
```

`crackmapexec` tool will pass the hash throughout the specified Subnet and check whether other machines can be accessed using Bruce Wayne's USERNAME and HASH.<br>
`crackmapexec` will return following status:
1. The SUCCESSFULL machines with a "Pwn3d!!" status.
2. The UNSUCCESFULL machines with a "STATUS LOGON FAILURE" status.

Since `Bruce Wayne` is the Local Admin of `FLASH`, it returns a `Pwn3d!` status. <br>
Now that we got the list of machines, we can gain an interactive shell using `psexec`<br>

```
psexec.py HERO/batman:@192.168.31.145 -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b
```
`-hashes` : hashes should be provided in `LMHASH:NTHASH` format.<br>
