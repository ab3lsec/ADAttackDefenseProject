# SMB Relay Attack Overview

### WHAT IS SMB RELAY?
In LLMNR attack we captured the user NTLMv2 hash, cracked it using `hashcat` <br>
But in SMB Relay attack, instead of cracking the NTLMv2 hash we obtained using `responder`, we can instead relay those credential hashes to specific target machines and gain access.

### TARGET REQUIREMENTS OF SMB RELAY:

#### 1. SMB SIGNING MUST BE DISABLED ON TARGET
If SMB signing feature is enabled on the target, then when we relay the hashes to target machine, it checks for the signature to make sure that the attempt was genuinely from the trusted machine.<br>
Since we relaying it, the signature won't match and it blocks our relay.

#### 2. RELAYED USER HASH MUST BE ADMIN ON THE TARGET
For Example: Bruce Wayne is an Local administrator of two machines (BATMAN & FLASH) Since we have the credential hash of Bruce Wayne, we need to target a machine where `Bruce Wayne` is ADMIN i.e Barry Allen's machine "`FLASH`".

### HOW THIS ATTACK WORKS?

- When DNS fails to resolve a request, an event occurs in `BATMAN` and `Responder` captures the credentials (Username and NTLMv2 Password hash) of `Bruce Wayne`.
- So instead of cracking the `BATMAN` hash, we use `ntlmrelayx` tool.
- This tool will relay these credentials to all those machines identified as targets where SMB signing is disabled. 
- If any machine has "`Bruce Wayne (batman)`" as their LOCAL ADMIN, it successfully authenticates into the target (`FLASH`) and dump the LOCAL SAM HASHES of that machine. 

*SAM hashes in Windows is similar to /etc/shadow file in Linux  which contains all the password hash and usernames of all the local users on the machine.*
<br>
Since SMB SIGNING is disabled, the target will no check the signature to ensure that request was from `BATMAN
