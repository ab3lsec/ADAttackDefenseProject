# SMB Relay LAB DEMO 

### STEP 1 : IDENTIFYING HOSTS WITH SMB SIGNING DISABLED

In order to perform an SMB Relay attack we need to check whether the target has SMB signing feature disabled. For doing this we can use an `nmap` script called `smb2-security-mode`.
<br>
This tool will start a script scan on each machine on the Subnet Range we given as input, this script will display the SMB SIGNING configuration of each machine.

```bash 
nmap --script=smb2-security-mode.nse "TARGET SUBNET"
```
![smbsign DC](https://github.com/ab3lsec/ADAttackDefenseProject/assets/87868050/103fb59a-3997-4c38-901d-2557b2489486)

<br>The scan result of JUSTICE-DC (Domain Controller) says that "`Message Signing is ENABLED and REQUIRED`". This means that SMB signing is enable and the machine will check all the signature to grand access into it.<br>
Since SMB signing is enabled, we can't use this as a target. <br>

![smbsign BATMAN](https://github.com/ab3lsec/ADAttackDefenseProject/assets/87868050/e679b4d9-9ed2-42bc-a4b9-a5b471abc020)
![smbsign FLASH](https://github.com/ab3lsec/ADAttackDefenseProject/assets/87868050/857ce410-dd42-4415-86e9-8e57b7d639bf)

<br>Now we have our user machines and the scan results says "`Message Signing is ENABLED and NOT REQUIRED`". This means that even though SMB signing is enabled, it doesn't require them. So when we make a request, it doesn't require any signature matching to grant access.

<br>In this case, we can choose `FLASH` as a target because SMB Signing is not Required and also `Bruce Wayne` whose NTLMv2 credentials we have is a LOCAL ADMIN on `FLASH`.

<br>So we can copy the IP of FLASH (`192.168.31.145`) into a text file named `targets.txt`

### STEP 2 : DISBALING SMB & HTTP IN RESPONDER:

We need to turn OFF the SMB and HTTP server option in Responder because unlike LLMNR Poisoning, we are not responding to anything using these servers, In SMB Relay we are just relaying NTLMv2 hash to the target machine. 

```
gedit /etc/responder/Responder.conf
```

###### NOTE : STEP 3 and STEP 4 should be done simultaneously by setting up both tools on different terminals. 

### STEP 3: SET UP RESPONDER TO CAPTURE THE NTLMv2 HASH

Set up responder on one terminal and trigger an event on `BATMAN`. The responder will start listening for events and once DNS fails, Responder grabs the username and NTLMv2 hash credentials of `Bruce Wayne`

```bash
responder -I eth0 -dwv
```

### STEP 4:  SET UP NTLMRELAYX TOOL

`ntlmrelayx` is the tool that relays the hash obtained via Responder to the Target machine (`FLASH`) and authenticates to FLASH (`192.168.31.145`) as its Local Admin `Bruce Wayne`.
<br>We need to set up this tool simultaneously on the second terminal.

```
ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt --smb2support
```
`-tf` : denotes the Target file which is the txt file where we saved the identified hosts.

![ntlmrela 1](https://github.com/ab3lsec/ADAttackDefenseProject/assets/87868050/3be9faec-1c00-4f15-bdbc-7e222ee2440a)
![SAM dump](https://github.com/ab3lsec/ADAttackDefenseProject/assets/87868050/86fafeeb-bd51-44a5-a7c3-1fc8fcbe8fed)

<br>We successfully authenticated to the target FLASH (`192.168.31.145`) as `Bruce Wayne` and the tool dumped the contents of local SAM database which has all the NTLM hashes of all local users.

<br>We can copy these hashes, try to crack them or we can also use them to access other machines via Lateral Movement.

### STEP 5:  OBTAINING AN INTERACTIVE SHELL

In normal SMB relay attack we dump the contents of Local SAM file. 
<br>Instead of this we can add an `-I` option to gain a interactive Shell into the target machine.

```
ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt --smb2support -i
```
![ntrelay shell](https://github.com/ab3lsec/ADAttackDefenseProject/assets/87868050/e94db6d0-d6ca-4f6d-a14f-1aeb2419a264)

<br>The tool successfully authenticated to the `FLASH` and opened an interactive shell session on `127.0.0.1` via Port `11001`. Now since we got the IP and port we can make a connection to it using tools like "netcat".
