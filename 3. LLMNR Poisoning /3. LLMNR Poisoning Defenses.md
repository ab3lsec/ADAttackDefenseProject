# LLMNR Poisoning Defence and Mitigation Strategies

Now through these lab we understood that turning ON LLMNR feature is a bad security practise. 
So here are some defences to prevent LLMNR poisoning attack:

##### 1. DISABLE LLMNR FEATURE
The best defence to mitigate LLMNR Poisoning is to disable all the LLMNR and NBT-NS features on the system.
To disable it navigate to "Group Policy Editor" and follow the path 

```
Local Computer Policy > Computer Configuration > Adinistrative Templates > Network > DNS Client

##### 2. ENABLE NETWORK ACCESS CONTROL (NAC)
- NAC stands for Network Access Control. 
- It means that proper security controls are enabled at each open port. 
- It check each connection made to a port and ensure that MAC address of connected device is allowed inside.
- So anyone cant just go and connect to an open port to access the internal network.

##### 3. STRONG PASSWORD POLICY
- The company should implement strong password policy which ensures all users are using a strong password with at least 14 characters and limit the common words usage.
- Because Longer the password takes longer time crack.
