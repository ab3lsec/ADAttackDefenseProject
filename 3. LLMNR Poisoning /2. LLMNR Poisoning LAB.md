# LLMNR Poisoning LAB DEMO 

To poison LLMNR we need to use a tool called "Responder" <br>
"Responder" will poison the LLMNR requests and listens for any events to occur.

1. Start responder tool with the following Syntax
```bash
responder -I eth0 -dwv
```
-I : used to denote Interface name <br>
-d : enables answers for DHCP requests <br>
-v : enables verbosity 

![responder](https://github.com/ab3lsec/ADAttackDefenseProject/assets/87868050/fceac1aa-f6b2-42bc-b15a-9cbafca0120a)
![resp2](https://github.com/ab3lsec/ADAttackDefenseProject/assets/87868050/4a5274ae-777d-4bf2-a237-579d6c299f7e)

2. Once started, Responder will start listening for any event to occur on the network - that means anyone to request a host that cannot be resolved by DNS.<br>
3. So lets go to "BATMAN" and make a fake request to trigger an event.

![fakeserver](https://github.com/ab3lsec/ADAttackDefenseProject/assets/87868050/969894c7-c206-4d35-a064-594e67888e06)

<br> In this case "fakeserver" is not a host and DNS will fail to resolve, Now the victim will look to resolve using LLMNR. <br>
Once the victim uses the LLMNR, the "Responder" tool will respond for request and capture the username and NTLMv2 Hash of the victim. <br>

![hash llmnsr](https://github.com/ab3lsec/ADAttackDefenseProject/assets/87868050/88290900-d3a1-47a3-8b07-a8c06005c39c)

We have successfully obtained the username (`HERO\batman`) and the NTLMv2 hash of the domain user "Bruce Wayne". <br>
We can crack this NTLMv2 hash using `hashcat` with the following syntax:

```
hashcat -m 5600 ntlmhash.txt rockyou.txt --force
```
