# An Overview on MIMIKATZ

### WHAT IS MIMIKATZ?

`mimikatz` is a very powerful post-exploitation tool which is used to view and steal credentials from the memory, Generate `kerberos` tickets which can be very useful in several attacks like Golden ticket, silver ticket etc..
This tool can be used in various attacks like:
1. Credential Dumping
2. Pass the Hash/  Over-pass the Hash
3. Pass the ticket
4. Golden ticket attacks
5. Silver ticket attacks etc..

### HOW MIMIKATZ WORKS?

`mimikatz` abuses and exploits the Single Sign-On functionality of Windows Authentication that allows the user to authenticate themselves only once in order to use various Windows services.
- In Windows, when a user logs into the system their credentials gets stored in Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) in the memory.
- We can login to a domain user shell using the credentials that we obtained in the initial compromise and then invoke `mimkatz`
- Once `mimkatz` is invoked, it loads its DLL into the library from where it can extract the credential hashes and dumps them onto the attacking system, and might even give us cleartext passwords

### WHY CREDENTIAL DUMPING IS USEFUL?

Once advantage of dumping credentials is we can use it fir lateral movement and Privilege escalation to compromise more users.
Other advantage is we can try to crack these hashes and analyse the password policy of the organization.
For example: if we got 100 hashes and we managed to crack almost 50 password in a short span. it means the passwords are weak and guessable. We can then report it to the client.
